# spam_mail_detection
Spam mail detection using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) involves building a model that can automatically identify and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones.

#Whenever you submit details about your email or contact number on any platform, it has become easy for those platforms to market their products by advertising them by sending emails or by sending messages directly to your contact number. This results in lots of spam alerts and notifications in your inbox. This is where the task of spam detection comes in.Using Natural Language Processing for SMS Spam Detection. To analyze the text messages and classify whether the message is ham or spam.

SMS is mainly used for unofficial communication such as promoting new products and services but at times also used for official communication like information about any bank transaction or confirmation of the order on an online portal etc.Due to advancements in technology, the costs of sending an SMS havebeen  reduced drastically.

This has proved to be a boon for some whereas a bane for many. People are misusing the SMS facility to promote products, services, offer, schemes, etc. 
people have started ignoring SMS they receive because twenty to thirty percent of the total SMS received is spam (Kim et al. (2015)). This  is growing at a rapid rate. As a result, people miss out on genuine informative messages such as bank transactions. This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms to separate spam messages from genuine ones. Machine learning techniques along with Natural Language Processing techniques was used to make the process more agile and efficient.
